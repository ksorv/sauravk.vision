## What is HTML?

**HTML** -> Stands for ***Hyper Text Markup Language***\
That means it's markup, not a programming language. **PERIOD**. It is the most basic thing you'll need to create a web page and is fundamental to almost all the front end frameworks.\
You are supposed to be using CSS and JS with this markup to create websites.

## HTML Elements!

HTML uses something that is called a element which is made of tags, attributes and content. Almost all the HTML elements have opening and closing tags. Let's see some elements:

`<p>This is a Paragraph tag</p>`

The above element is a p tag, used to create paragraphs as one that you are reading. Notice it has `<p>` at start and `</p>` at the end, these are called opening and closing tags respectively.  The text between is content. Let's see another example:

`<img src="/path/image.jpg" />`

This is an image tag, it has no closing tag. But a simple `/>`.  Img elements are **empty elements,** needs no content and/or closing tags.

A good picture from [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started) is:

That said now you know what html is made of, let's teach you some tags and stuff.

## HTML Tags

**I've a pen, on which when you click you'll see HTML and its preview on the side. You don't need to understand anything, Right now!** Just have a look!

There are may be 100 HTML tags that you'll learn someday. I wont write all of them here, as there is no need for that.  I'll list out those which are handy and used most:

* `<hX>This is a heading!</hX>` You can use X=1,2...,7.. whatever.
* `<p>This is a paragraph tag</p>`
* `<img src="./path/image.jpg" alt="This is alt text"/>`
* `<strong>This is strong tag, used to bold the text.</strong>`
* `<em>This tag is used for italic text.</em>`
* `<span>Generally used where you want to style text.</span>`
* `<br />` This is a break tag, used to get something into new line.
* `<ul><li>This is an item in unordered list.</li><ul>`
* `<ol><li>This is an item in ordered list.</li><ol>`
* `<a href="https://sauravk.vision" target="_blank">A anchor tag</a>`
* `<input type="text">` This is an input element.
* `<form>This is form element.</form>
* `<button><This is a button/button>`

That's all I'll tell you for now. Now see this and check how all of these looks, you can also change anything to see preview.

## Wrapping up

This was everything about HTML that you needed to learn. You can constantly practice writing HTML and/or creating sites, what will follow is that you'll start to remember all these things like *tags* and *attrs*. So, we're done with HTML.
