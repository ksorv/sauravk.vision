**Here is the HTML5 course for beginners!**

I'm making this, cause when I started I grew tired of seeing the same shit everywhere.
Every course started with so called **HTML Basics**. So, here they are!

Now, after this If I saw any of you seeing any other Html basic course, **I'll kill you**. After this, you'll know HTML enough, enough to create whatever you want.

## What is HTML?

**HTML** -> Stands for **_Hyper Text Markup Language_**

That means it's markup, not a programming language. **PERIOD**.

## Wrapping up

This was everything about HTML that you needed to learn. You can constantly practice writing HTML and/or creating sites, what will follow is that you'll start to remember all these things like _tags_ and _attrs_. So, we're done with HTML. Check out other [Courses](/tags/courses), such as on [CSS basics](/posts/css-for-beginners), [JS basics](/posts/js-for-beginners) and what not.
